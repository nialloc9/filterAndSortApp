# filterAndSortApp
This is an application that takes JSON data and sorts and filters it before displaying it to the user. It is created using angularJs. Screenshots have been added for your consideration.

##Installation
* Clone Repo.
* npm install

##Why angularJs?
* Http service
* Flexible filters
* Data binding

##Project considerations
* To make the application easier to scale adding a database instead of a json file would be ideal.
* If a database is used PDO can be used to help prevent sql injection.
* Jasmine and Karma can be used to test application.
